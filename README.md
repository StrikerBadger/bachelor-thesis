# Bachelor's Thesis
## xG Values
### Sources
Statsbomb and Understat both provide xG values free for non-commercial use. 
To assess what the better source for the xG values is we have to look at xG values for shots/matches which are represented in both sources.
**Understat indexed competitions**
Understat indexes 6 different leagues:
- Premier League
- La Liga
- Bundesliga
- Serie A
- Ligue 1
- RFPL

**Intersection of Understat and Statsbomb**
Looking at the [competitions which are indexed by statsbomb open data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data/blob/master/data/competitions.json) we can make out the competitions which are indexed by both data providers:
- Premier League
    - Season 2015/16
- La Liga
    - Season 2014/15
    - Season 2015/16
    - Season 2016/17
    - Season 2017/18
    - Season 2018/19
    - Season 2019/20
    - Season 2020/21
- Bundesliga
    - Season 2015/16
- Serie A
    - Season 2015/16
- Ligue 1
    - Season 2015/16

Statsbomb only indexes a very small subset of the La Liga.

# TODO
Do descriptive analysis on the two datasets
